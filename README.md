pollNew.py contains the final code, it generates the bar graphs using existing data files.

The role of Social Media in predicting real world phenomena is
getting increasingly popular. Tracking people’s activity provides a
spontaneous way to guess their preferences. Using proper metric
and algorithm in datasets found from social media can eliminate
the need to conduct polls by directly interacting with humans. This
papers analyses data found in one of the most popular social media
platform Twitter and compares them with real world data. The
comparison is based on several criteria and focuses on exploring
the most significant one for future works. This is a groundwork for
further exploration into this area.
